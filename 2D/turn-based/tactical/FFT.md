## Elements that made it a Good Game

- The Job System allowed units to learn new skills by acquiring experience in a "job" and then buying the skill with job points.
- The ability to have a sub-job effectively meant you got good customization for your units and their role.
- The poaching system made gave you a reason to want to have random encounters to get better equipment.
- The maps could lead to challenging situations, as most skills and attacks could only be used within certain height distances of the user.
- The balance between most classes meant that moving to more advanced classes was usually the best option, but there was always a trade-off to be made. Essentially, you moved from generalists to specialists.
- Catching and Stealing opened up avenues to get new equipment, sometimes only from one battle.
- Lots of side quests and optional unique characters.
- Combat was challenging with a lot of planning involved in picking a winning strategy.
- Attacks would have different areas that they effected, and could effect your units, meaning placement was critical.
- Whether you were in front, to the side, or behind a unit effected chances of an attack landing and chances of a counter attack.
- You could acquire some magic by having it cast on you, which introduced an interesting mechanic to the game.

## Gameplay System Notes
- Meaningful character advancement decisions.
- Squad size meant fast turns.
- Job system meant you had to go through some jobs you didn't want to get to the ones you did, so there was a reason to go through jobs.
- Attacks being more successful from behind or the side, and having less likelyhood of counter attacks compared to head on, added to strategy.
- Attack areas made positioning important.
- Being able to learn from enemy attacks enabled a new strategy of play.
