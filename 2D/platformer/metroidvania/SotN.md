## Elements that made it Good

- In a first for Castlevania games you had to travel around the map (not just go in a linear fashion to the end) to obtain powers and unlock areas. This is something that Metroid kind of pioneered, but it made a lot of sense for the setting.
- Enemies could drop items (armor, weapons, consumables) that could be used by the protagonist, effectively giving you a reason to kill the enemies other than just survival. However, none of these dropped items were critical for advancing the game. All game advancing items could be discovered in the levels themselves.
- There was a map that showed where you had been. By buying the map in the library you could get some, but not all, the map filled in (with the parts you haden't been darker). This made it possible to determine where you wanted to go as well.
- In another first for Castlevania games you had a level, and defeating enemies advanced your level, and therefore your stats. This meant that there could be parts of the castle available to you that you probably couldn't navigate because the enemies were too hard, but that wasn't a deal breaker because you could get better stats.
- The items you collected were presistent, and your game could be saved. Progress was measured in your level, your equipment, and the amount of map that had been opened up.
- Although there was plenty of the game that was required, most of it was optional. If you failed to obtain the two rings required to get the helmet that would allow you to see that Richter was being controlled in the final boss fight in the normal castle you'd get one ending. But they'd drop the upside-down castle on the first castle if you did, effectively doubling the game. This gave you a reason to seek out the optional areas.
- The optional areas in the normal castle contributed to the value of the game by allowing the upside-down castle, but for getting the optional areas of the upside-down castle the motivator was Walk Armor, which increased in defense with the amount of map coverage.
- Weapons could have optional special moves, which meant in certain cases having not the highest attack weapon was better for your play-style, and gave you a reason to use different weapons.
- Armor could have elements (and, in at least two cases, other effects) which could make you immune to certain attacks, giving you a reason to not just use the highest defense armor.
- After defeating the game you could play again as a different character: Richter. Richter didn't get any of the items or equipment, but did still get more health and hearts. This added to replay value.
- The music was astoundly good, and the graphics were excellent, especially considering that virtually everything was experimenting with poorly rendered 3D at the time.
- The plot made sense (for a video game) and incorporated aspects of lore from previous Castlevania games directly, making it feel like you were continuing a narative instead of in a stand-alone game.

## Gameplay System Notes

- Meaningful items
- Exploration aspect / unlockable areas
- Persistant achievements through level, inventory, and exploration
- Optional, but meaningful, areas
- Exploration was not linear / some areas could be too hard initially
