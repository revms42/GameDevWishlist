## What Makes a Good Game?
If you look at computer games from the very first examples till today it's clear that a lot of progress has been made in the realm of computer games. Graphics have obviously gotten better, games have gotten bigger, the role of games in our society has shifted completely... there's very little that's stayed the same. Certain aspects it's easy to say that progress has been fairly linear, or, at least, fairly forward. But that's not universally true. It's especially not true of the game systems that make games fun to play.

Take as an example Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. This game came out in 1997 and since then there have been 17 more Castlevania games (more than came before) and none have come close to having the acclaim (or, IMHO, being as fun) as SotN. And it's not for lack of trying: Many of the sequals tried to capitalize on SotN's model, and some came close, but none really had the same appeal.

What about SotN made it better than it's kin? Why are so many games chasing it's success? Why are so many failing to obtain it? What made it a good game?

## The Project
The whole point of this project is to try and identify games that did things well, and identify what they did well and why. Where possible we also want to identify where improvements could be made, and what those improvements might look like. The method will be to look at games first in terms of type (grouped by category of play, type of graphics, etc...) and get people's opinions on what made them good or bad. From there, the goal will be to distill those opinions into a learning about what makes some aspect of that type of game "good", and create lists of criteria that we think will result in a good game.

## The Goal
Why go to all this trouble? It's pretty obvious that game development studios (especially big game development studios) aren't necessarily trying to develop games that are what we would call "good". Between the dawn of microtransactions, the glut of photorealistic bloodbath games, and rampant oversexualizing of characters there's very few games with either widespread appeal or genuine replay value. This is, unfortunately, to be expected; game studios are in the business of selling games. For them sales are all that matter, and replay value is actually something to be avoided at all costs (after all, how are they going to sell new games if you're still playing old games).

So, what do we do once we have our lists of criteria? Well, the short answer is try and create some frameworks for creating games that make meeting those criteria easy. One of the barriers to game development (in my estimation) is a lack of adequate support for hobbiests who want to make games. There are plenty of game engines out there, but, despite the fact that most games of any given type you want to name work virtually in an identical fashion under the hood, there almost no resources for jumping right into the parts of the game creation that really makes a game unique (e.g. art, story, systems, etc....). Usually, the reason given is that it is up to you, the programmer, to implement it in whatever way you wish. In reality, the underpinnings of the game which make it possible to build the interesting things on top represent trade secrets that no one wants to part with (think about how easy it would be to make your own Super Mario Bros. clone if they actually gave you the engine from the get-go).

## The Rules
- Anyone is allowed to bring in a game they think was good, as long as they can identify the elements of the gameplay (not art style, or story, or music, or community... only systems that contribute to enjoyment) that made it good.
- Anyone is allowed to agree / disagree with another person as long as they do so politely.
- Disagreements that can't be resolved get boiled down to their respective positions regarding the element in question.
- When a general concensus looks like it's been reached, a list of criteria will begin to be compiled.
- Once the criteria list seems big enough to start work on, we'll look to start (open source) projects to support creating those types of games.
  - (I'll be looking to implement them in a fork of the LWJGL created by [Anuken](https://github.com/anuken) called [Arc](https://github.com/Anuken/Arc), or possibly a fork of Arc with Kotlin support, specifically because it's open-source, platform agnostic, and used on a commercially sucessful game, but I encourage anyone to start their own if they want to use a different platform).
- As the criteria expand we'll expect to roll those learnings into the projects themselves.
- When someone uses those projects to create games, we can circle back and see if there are more learnings from the games that have been made to add to the criteria.

## Contact
I'll be maintain topics in my private slack channel ([Whizzo Butter](whizzobutter.slack.com)), but I'm going to be pretty selective about who gets added there.

Feel free to open PR's and assign them to me and I'll check them out and make sure they follow the rules.
